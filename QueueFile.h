/**
 * A reliable, efficient, file-based, FIFO queue. Additions and removals are O(1). All operations
 * are atomic. Writes are synchronous; data will be written to disk before an operation returns.
 * The underlying file is structured to survive process and even system crashes. If an I/O
 * exception is thrown during a mutating change, the change is aborted. It is safe to continue to
 * use a {@code QueueFile} instance after an exception.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 *
 * <p>In a traditional queue, the remove operation returns an element. In this queue,
 * {@link #peek} and {@link #remove} are used in conjunction. Use
 * {@code peek} to retrieve the first element, and then {@code remove} to remove it after
 * successful processing. If the system crashes after {@code peek} and during processing, the
 * element will remain in the queue, to be processed when the system restarts.
 *
 * <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The current implementation is built for file systems that support
 * atomic segment writes (like YAFFS). Most conventional file systems don't support this; if the
 * power goes out while writing a segment, the segment will contain garbage and the file will be
 * corrupt. We'll add journaling support so this class can be used with more file systems later.
